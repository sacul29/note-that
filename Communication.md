## **Team Communication** ##

### _Interpersonal communication:_ ###
Our communication was mainly through a group Facebook message or in person when we would meet up to discuss aspects of the project. We found that using a group message was useful for communicating about meeting up or allocating tasks, but working together in person was the most useful for actually getting our project done. We were able to communicate more effectively and efficiently through it and help one another out on various aspects of the project.

### _Bug tracking:_ ###
Bugs were found through the code review as we'd test out our functionality. We tested out the extension using various permutations of our functionalities and discovered a multitude of different ways in which our program could go wrong. For example, testing out the different ways we could use the commenting functionality led us to discover that in one version of our code, if we selected a section of text that had previously been selected for commenting, it would delete the comment box and merge the comment into the page's content.

Bugs were tracked through issues that were filed and within code reviews. Smaller bugs were discussed when we were working together and resolved on the spot.

### _Code reviews:_ ###
Code reviews were conducted once we reached a stage where the extension had enough of a functionality implemented such that it was important to double check that our code was completely and correctly implementing the current design. As each feature was updated, it was tested in practice and its code was looked over to double check that everything was documented properly and the documentation was updated, any redundant or unused code was deleted, and variables were created with meaningful names.

### _Source control management:_ ###
We used Git for version control; the commits can be seen in Source -> Changes.
